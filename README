**Output is the step number followed by the runtime for 
that step of the algorithm**

The program implements full multigrid algorithm for the 3D heat
equation.  Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Gauss-Seidel with black/red
ordering are options for sweeps that can be commented out or 
uncommented to select the desired method (in subroutine relax).
The jacobi method is currently set. 

The inclusion of a heat source at the center of the 3D cube is
supported by the code. To change the value of this source, the
value of the s needs to be changed in initialize (last line of
code).

There are initialize, relax, slvsml, rstrct, interp, resid, and
addint subroutines included in the program.
